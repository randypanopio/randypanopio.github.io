              Gallium Chalice is an action detective video game, set medieval times within the Kingdom of Gallium. This one month project was researched and developed by my group, Spaghetti Squad, in summer 2017. The goal was to build an interesting game from the ground
              up and learn to apply testing methodologies and how to develop games with a proper narrative arc.
              <br /> <br /> Gallium Challice contains a full foldback (branching) narrative structure, simple combat system, and investigation system that the drives gameplay.

              chalice.

              The game follows similar 2d RPG style action games with elements of finding items, investigating through dialogue, fighting aggressors, and having the ability to accuse characters to the crime.

              Since the goal of this project was investigate how to properly implement a narrative arc into a game while keeping the gameplay fun, we had to go through various iterations of design. In order to accommodate time, we first used storyboards and physical
              prototypes to test others to see what is working and what needs improvement.

              We first used a rough storyboard with how we envisioned our game functioned and tested users with our physical prototypes to get feedback. From these tests, we began to refine our storyboard and began building the first digital game.

              We also went through a few more tests as we improved the digital game until we were satisfied with the final delivery. This also helped us address glaring issues and any bugs of the core gameplay.

              Gallium Challice was built and scripted inside the Unity Engine with visual assets built from Photoshop. While this project was not my first game developed in Unity, it was the first project where it had a proper narrative setting. When we started this
              project, I began to drift towards becoming the design lead of how the general gameplay should work. This led me to begin designing what kinds of player to game-world interactions we should do and what types of mechanics the game should use.
              This also led to me becoming the lead programmer in the digital phase as I was also had the most experience with Unity. I also became the person who directed my group members regarding what smaller scripts needed to be done as well as debugging
              any issues of the game.

              Creating Gallium Challice was a very insightful and sometimes a frustrating learning experience. The scope of this project relied a lot on working as a cohesive team, and really improved my skills in dealing with group issues and leading the team towards
              our end goal. It also broadened my insight on how to approach game design as well as further improving my technical skills such as scripting.
              <br />
              <br /> This project still has much left to improve as there still some pesky bugs needed to be squashed. There are also areas that need improvement such as a smoother combat system, a larger world and expanded narrative, and even creating
              its own original music. I have learned a lot from this project, but have also left me wanting something even better.
