              I worked at Safe Software Inc. as a Web Developer for the FME Server product. There I
worked within an agile team to discuss and implement planned features and working to meet
product goals. I created wireframes and mockups for both new features and refining existing
interface, then implementing them within HTML, Sass, and hybrid Angular/AngularJS
framework.

              Automations has been a long running project that started before my time at Safe
Software. As the project grew closer towards release, I worked closely with stakeholders to
refine the boilerplate interface, building enhancement features, and tweaking user flows.

            <p>
              An example is designing how users navigate to their automation workflows and manage or edit
them. I approached these widely scoped projects first by researching how users would
approach this task in the context of the product, then building mockups and share them to my
supervisor/stakeholders. Then after further refinement and research, I implement my ideas to
our project.

              Some enhancements from this process sprouted the ideas of image previews for quick visibility
of existing workflows, and a “quick-start” overlay that points to the user tips on how to use the
tool, as well as a page where users can quickly see their last workflows. These enhancement
was aimed to giving new users some guidance when first starting up the new tool, as well as a
place where users can quickly access different components of the tool, or dive straight into
building their workflows. I also refined the user flow for managing existing workflows to be
familiar to existing similar features throughout the product while having different features be
readily accessible.

            <p>
              As our team worked on Automations, it’s interface needed more polish as the project
came closer to release. Using the same research and design process I did for the user flows on
accessing Automations, I improved upon the interface in steps. The old navigation, and toolbar
access made it feel outdated and clunky to use. I condensed information and updated the look
of the buttons to feel less compressed and easy to use on all screen sizes.

              The core aspect that went through several iterations were the “nodes” of the tool. These nodes
were the core component for conveying information to our users on building out their
workflows. I was tasked to design and implement and improved the node’s visual aesthetics,
and interactions. By researching competitors, our own existing diagraming tools, and
conducting user research to internal users, FME Server Automations nodes were completed
with usability, aesthetics, and condensing information in check.

              Working on the Automations project, I mainly focused on usability as we rolled out new
features for the tool. Much like how I designed my other ideas, each individual decision on
building out features I was tasked for, I try to weave in enhancements to make using
Automations easier and friendlier to use. Other user experience changes I worked on were
cleaning up the “smart-linking” of Automation nodes as a neat minor feature that helps users
building their workflows.

              I also collaborated with a back-end developer to store settings specific to the user’s
preferences on the interface, and persist those settings on different browsers. My goal for these
decisions are hopefully only to further improve the FME Server product.

              Working within this project and at Safe Software has given me plenty of insight in
working within front-end development. I refined my ideas through our feature demos once they
are completed, or asking opinions through our internal experts who use these tools and help
clients using FME Server’s tools, or even asking other developers who are associated with FME
Server for their opinions, all have helped me become a better designer and developer. I was also
able to experience working on an agile environment, as well as the experience of working with
product owners, qa’s and other developers all working on building a wonderful product.
