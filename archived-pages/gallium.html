              Gallium Chalice is an adventure detective game following the story of Conrad,  the hero of Gallium. Gallium Chalice delves into the odd Kingdom of Gallium, where we take a page on one of the more quaint pages of the hero's many adventures as he investigates a sudden thievery incident.

              Gallium Chalice was a one month long project for a games class in summer 2017. Our goal was to build an engaging game from the ground up and learn how to apply play testing methodologies and how to develop games with an interesting narrative arc.

              The player controls the hero, Conrad, who is visiting King Feldor's castle to investigate the Kingâ€™s missing treasury. Conrad arrives at the castle to find that there seems to be some swindling afoot and must ask questions about the castle dwellers to find who stole the treasury.
              <br>
              <br>
              The player must talk to various NPCs in order to obtain clues about who in the castle is the culprit. Each conversation can provide hints on who to talk to or where to go, which the player can keep track of by checking their inventory quest log. The player can also collect items that the player can use as evidence, and as clues on who they should be pursuing next.
              <br>
              <br>
              The player can accuse anybody and confront who they think is the thief at any time, however if they accuse too many times incorrectly without the proper evidence may lead to the Hero losing his title.

              The goal of this project was to learn how to properly implement a narrative arc into a game while keeping the gameplay fun, we had to go through various iterations of design. After brainstorming our first ideas, we first used storyboards and physical prototypes to test players to see what is working and what needs improvement.

              We first used a rough storyboard with how we envisioned our game functioned and tested users with our physical (pen and paper) prototypes to get feedback. One of the main things we found during this phase was finding that extra unique hook to complement the game. As we ideated from our playtests, we had come up with the accusation mechanic, and had shaped our core gameplay from that. From these tests, we began to refine our storyboard and began building the first digital game.

              We spent a lot of time designing the various game-world interactions that the player must do, which we refined over time through our various stages of play testing.  As we began working on our final prototype, I took on the role as the design lead, which in turn also led me into being our primary programmer. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I was in charge of creating the groundworks of the game, including player controls, scene management, as well as managing co-collaboration with Unity. My primary job was implementing our Dialogue system, including the UI, the text parsing system used by our writers as they changed and added the dialogue into the game, and the accusation system.

              Creating Gallium Chalice was both an exciting, yet a frustrating learning experience. The scope of this project relied a lot on working as a cohesive team, and really improved my skills in dealing with group issues and leading the team towards our end goal. 
              <br>
              <br>
              In the short time of this project, I learned a lot of technical skills such as building simple tools in Unity, and how to implement a dialogue system. This experience also taught me how to collaborate with teams on a game. I learned that to be a leader, you <span class="">need to pick up on the smaller side of details</span> during collaboration, as <span class="">some of the best ideas may come from it.</span>
